### Unit  README: Red Vs. Blue Team Project 

## Unit Description

Assessment, Analysis, and Hardening of a vulnerable system. This report includes a Red Team Security Assessment, a Blue Team Log Analysis, and Hardening and Mitigation Strategies. 

## Project Description

In the second project week, you will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.

Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.
